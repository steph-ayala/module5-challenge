# module5-challenge

This project analyzed a mouse tumor study to investigate the effects of various drug regimens on tumor volume. After cleaning the data and removing duplicates, summary statistics were generated, revealing differences in tumor responses among treatments. Visualizations, including scatter plots and box plots, highlighted relationships between mouse weight and tumor volume, showing a moderate positive correlation. The analysis demonstrated the importance of data cleaning, visualization, and statistical methods in deriving meaningful insights from biomedical research.

This project focused on analyzing a dataset from a mouse tumor study, specifically examining the effects of different drug regimens on tumor volume. The analysis utilized data from two CSV files. Key objectives included data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand the relationships between mouse weight, treatment regimens, and tumor volume.
